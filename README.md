## Sleep dataset
The attached code is intended to analyze the data concerning a patient’s sleep, provided via an excel file. It is important that the dataset respects the following format: data placed in chronological order and containing the following 17 variables
 
    - Date
    - Minutes of nap
    - Time the patient went to bed
    - Time the patient turned off the light
    - How quickly the patient fell asleep since the light was turned off
    - Expected waking time
    - Actual waking time
    - Time when the patient gets out of bed
    - How many times did the patient wake up during the night
    - How many minutes did the patient stay awake during the night
    - Sleep disturbance level (from 1 to 10)
    - Sleep quality level (from 1 to 10)
    - Fatigue level (from 1 to 10)
    - Level of sleepiness (from 1 to 10)
    - Activity goal (registered by the polar device)
    - Actual sleep (registered by the polar device)
    - Sleep continuity (registered by the polar device)
    
To use this program, you just have to put the code and the dataset in the same folder, then you have to open jupyter notebook (after installing the libraries pandas, numpy and matplotlib) and start running the code. It is important, when the program will ask you to enter the dataset’s name, to add at the and of the file name ‘.xlsx’. 
After running all blocks of code, all graphs will be displayed to complete the analysis.
